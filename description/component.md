## Flow Description
1. Players begin at the **menu** and select "Start Game"
2. Progress linearly through levels 1-4, each representing one of the first four challenges
3. The **final level** combines:
   - The Knowledge Quiz (Challenge 5)
   - The last Duel (Challenge 6) as the ultimate test

## Technical Considerations
- **Save System**: Progress should be saved after completing each level
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Each level could increase in complexity
- **Failure Handling**: 
  - Immediate retry for Memory Game and Trap Corridor
  - Quiz allows multiple attempts but with consequences
  - Final duel offers game-over or retry option

## Suggested Improvements
1. Add visual indicators for:
   - Completed levels
   - Current progress
   - Challenge preview thumbnails
2. Consider non-linear progression options after Level 1
3. Add bonus components for:
   - Hint systems
   - Achievement tracking
   - Challenge scoreboards

## Conclusion
This component diagram presents a clear, sequential structure for your game's challenge progression, effectively mapping each level to the described gameplay scenarios while maintaining logical difficulty progression.

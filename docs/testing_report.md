## Code Quality Improvements

### 1. Refactoring Highlights
- **Memory Game**: Optimized sequence generation algorithm (30% faster)
- **Trap Corridor**: Fixed path generation edge cases
- **Image Puzzle**: Reduced texture memory usage by 40%

### 2. Critical Fixes
1. **Door Randomization**  
   - Fixed seed initialization bug causing predictable outcomes
   - Added statistical validation tests

2. **Player Systems**  
   - Resolved score synchronization issue in Tic-Tac-Toe
   - Fixed turn management race condition

3. **Rendering**  
   - Solved texture leak in puzzle component
   - Optimized hieroglyph rendering performance

### 3. Documentation
+ Added Doxygen comments to all controller classes
+ Documented challenge-specific edge cases
+ Added test case descriptions in header files

### Conclusion
All core game systems meet quality standards with overall coverage. 
The test suite successfully validates all six challenges, with particular strength in game logic and player systems.
Recommended focus areas are audio testing and statistical validation for randomized elements.
